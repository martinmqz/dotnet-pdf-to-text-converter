Create customized web tools and web apps from scratch based on user needs. Excel in rapid prototyping following the agile methodology. Sites’ content is managed by a complex CMS, SDL Tridion, which was customized to render content in a headless hybrid manner to be consumed on the client-side by ReactJS and pure JavaScript. So, I create in SDL Tridion, custom components, component templates, page templates, schemas, Razor templates, etc. as well as custom CMS’s functionalities like Custom Resolver. Responsibilities – Lead developer – Create rapid web solutions based on the user and team needs – ReactJS and back-end CMS componentizing – Build advanced JavaScript min apps that work in harmony with ReactJS and CMS-rendered markup – Have fun creating web design suggestions to improve the user experience #webdesign – Testing & debugging – Rapid solutions and fixes under limited technical-environmental conditions – Code reviews and approvals // GitHub, SDL Tridion 
 2 – Agile methodology // Kanban, Scrumban  – Recent relevant projects  Recent relevant projects 1) STICKY-TABS & STICKY-NAV The main challenge was making these apps content-author managed since the CMS dictates areas in the site where a component’s content will be rendered, so a regular tabbed content (where the content of each tab is wrapped in a container that you can easily hide/show) would not work. So, I had to handle the tab panels programmatically by creating -virtual- panels for each tab (Note that we are talking about content that is already wrapped in bootstrap-grid rows and columns). Challenges – Content-author manageable without modifying existing functionalities, authors should add these features on any page they wish – Similar approach for the sticky-nav – Do not modify bootstrap grid template nor CMS (SDL Tridion) page template – Converting the tabs and navbar dynamically into dropdown menus for mobile browsers – Need to work in harmony with existing ReactJS components Technologies – Advanced JavaScript – ReactJS & Typescript – SAAS – HTML/CSS – Bootstrap  – SDL Tridion  – Razor.net – Nodejs & NPM – GitHub – VSCode – Browser dev tools  2) MANUALLY TRANSPILE LEGACY SERVER-SIDE CODE INTO JAVASCRIPT This was an enormous challenge since the original code was not an official language so there is no documentation at all. Many years passed and no developer or manager wanted to take this project because it was an extreme difficult time consuming and expensive effort. It was until recently (late 2020) that we had no option we had to address this technical debt or we would be in big trouble, so I started working on it on my end (outside of work hours, and many weekends) and I made a huge progress so I told the team that it was in fact do-able without hiring SDL Experts (which would take them at least a year). No one believed me at first until they say the huge progress that I had done. So at the end, I re-built this important section (Fund Profiles), and finally got rid of all the dependencies on the terrible custom tag-language made by a third-party company. This was a big win for the team and the company. I got big recognition for my ‘stubbornness’ to fix the ‘impossible’. Technologies – RSTL (Custom tag-language created by a 3rd-party company) – Advanced JavaScript – Razor.net – SDL Tridion  – SON – XML – ReactJS – HTML/CSS – VSCode – Nodejs & NPM 
 3 3) SDL TRIDION CUSTOM RESOLVER This was another big challenge since the current custom resolver was causing publishing issues, which is critical for the business. The company hired an expensive SDL expert who ended not being able to fix the issue. So, here is where I volunteered again regardless the skepticism of the team.  In a few weeks I was able to write a new Custom Resolver that was simpler and faster, saving the company which made me gain another recognition. Technologies – SDL Tridion – C# – Visual Studio – GitHub - SDL Template Builder   Owner – Full-stack Web Developer & Web Designer at Webect 2004 – 2014 San Francisco, CA Webect was a web development firm that provided online services and solutions.

 4 At the time I was introduced on this project, the client company (Genentech) had approved only the functionality of the survey, but not the design & UX. So it was urgent to start working immediately on the aesthetics and user-friendliness of this product. Infinata already had ideas of how they wanted the survey to function and look like, so after brainstorming together and creating several mock-ups, we came up with this final version of the survey. The client, Genentech, was and currently is very happy with the product. Challenge Not allowed to change rendered HTML by the CMS, so all the manipulation had to be done dynamically in JavaScript and CSS Tech features – HTML manipulation with pure CSS – Custom pure JavaScript scripting for the new functionalities – Progress-indicator “well” boxes. The “well” is filled up based on the amount of questions answered. – Asynchronous save/submit – Check-record-lock. (Yellow alert box) Pops up if other user is working on the same survey – Cross-browser compatible HTML/CSS – Check-record-lock. (Yellow alert box) Pops up if other user is working on the same survey – All the data is dynamic. (CMS like administration pages. Client can create/edit/delete surveys,etc) – the data is dynamic. (CMS like administration pages. Client can create/edit/delete surveys,etc) – SPA (Single-page-application) experience – Design & UX created from scratch Technologies Advanced JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, Joomla, SPA, Web Design, UX Design, Photoshop.  Data-file downloader Bot Infinata back-end developers requested my help with this project since their previous solution was not really getting the job done. The goal is to download on a daily basis, clinical trials data  records from a third-party company. The request was to come-up with a quick and efficient solution to achieve the goal. The solution, a bot (robot) program to simulate a real web-browser user. This “bot” application is now being run through windows server scheduled tasks. Challenge Find a solution to download heavy xml files on a scheduled basis from third-party service company Technologies and features C# Windows Forms to build a custom web browser, automated actions (macros), architecture the concept and implementation from scratch, Visual Studio.

Create customized web tools and web apps from scratch based on user needs. Excel in rapid prototyping following the agile methodology. Sites’ content is managed by a complex CMS, SDL Tridion, which was customized to render content in a headless hybrid manner to be consumed on the client-side by ReactJS and pure JavaScript. So, I create in SDL Tridion, custom components, component templates, page templates, schemas, Razor templates, etc. as well as custom CMS’s functionalities like Custom Resolver. Responsibilities – Lead developer – Create rapid web solutions based on the user and team needs – ReactJS and back-end CMS componentizing – Build advanced JavaScript min apps that work in harmony with ReactJS and CMS-rendered markup – Have fun creating web design suggestions to improve the user experience #webdesign – Testing & debugging – Rapid solutions and fixes under limited technical-environmental conditions – Code reviews and approvals // GitHub, SDL Tridion 
 2 – Agile methodology // Kanban, Scrumban  – Recent relevant projects  Recent relevant projects 1) STICKY-TABS & STICKY-NAV The main challenge was making these apps content-author managed since the CMS dictates areas in the site where a component’s content will be rendered, so a regular tabbed content (where the content of each tab is wrapped in a container that you can easily hide/show) would not work. So, I had to handle the tab panels programmatically by creating -virtual- panels for each tab (Note that we are talking about content that is already wrapped in bootstrap-grid rows and columns). Challenges – Content-author manageable without modifying existing functionalities, authors should add these features on any page they wish – Similar approach for the sticky-nav – Do not modify bootstrap grid template nor CMS (SDL Tridion) page template – Converting the tabs and navbar dynamically into dropdown menus for mobile browsers – Need to work in harmony with existing ReactJS components Technologies – Advanced JavaScript – ReactJS & Typescript – SAAS – HTML/CSS – Bootstrap  – SDL Tridion  – Razor.net – Nodejs & NPM – GitHub – VSCode – Browser dev tools  2) MANUALLY TRANSPILE LEGACY SERVER-SIDE CODE INTO JAVASCRIPT This was an enormous challenge since the original code was not an official language so there is no documentation at all. Many years passed and no developer or manager wanted to take this project because it was an extreme difficult time consuming and expensive effort. It was until recently (late 2020) that we had no option we had to address this technical debt or we would be in big trouble, so I started working on it on my end (outside of work hours, and many weekends) and I made a huge progress so I told the team that it was in fact do-able without hiring SDL Experts (which would take them at least a year). No one believed me at first until they say the huge progress that I had done. So at the end, I re-built this important section (Fund Profiles), and finally got rid of all the dependencies on the terrible custom tag-language made by a third-party company. This was a big win for the team and the company. I got big recognition for my ‘stubbornness’ to fix the ‘impossible’. Technologies – RSTL (Custom tag-language created by a 3rd-party company) – Advanced JavaScript – Razor.net – SDL Tridion  – SON – XML – ReactJS – HTML/CSS – VSCode – Nodejs & NPM 
 3 3) SDL TRIDION CUSTOM RESOLVER This was another big challenge since the current custom resolver was causing publishing issues, which is critical for the business. The company hired an expensive SDL expert who ended not being able to fix the issue. So, here is where I volunteered again regardless the skepticism of the team.  In a few weeks I was able to write a new Custom Resolver that was simpler and faster, saving the company which made me gain another recognition. Technologies – SDL Tridion – C# – Visual Studio – GitHub - SDL Template Builder   Owner – Full-stack Web Developer & Web Designer at Webect 2004 – 2014 San Francisco, CA Webect was a web development firm that provided online services and solutions such as Web Design, Web Development, Custom Programming, SEO, Custom jQuery/JavaScript scripting, CMS support (third-party CMS and custom-built CMS solutions).

 4 Relevant projects SiteSurvey Improved design and user experience without altering their pre-defined HTML markup, as well as adding new functionalities based on rapidly changing requirements.  At the time I was introduced on this project, the client company (Genentech) had approved only the functionality of the survey, but not the design & UX. So it was urgent to start working immediately on the aesthetics and user-friendliness of this product. Infinata already had ideas of how they wanted the survey to function and look like, so after brainstorming together and creating several mock-ups, we came up with this final version of the survey. The client, Genentech, was and currently is very happy with the product. Challenge Not allowed to change rendered HTML by the CMS, so all the manipulation had to be done dynamically in JavaScript and CSS Tech features – HTML manipulation with pure CSS – Custom pure JavaScript scripting for the new functionalities – Progress-indicator “well” boxes. The “well” is filled up based on the amount of questions answered. – Asynchronous save/submit – Check-record-lock. (Yellow alert box) Pops up if other user is working on the same survey – Cross-browser compatible HTML/CSS – Check-record-lock. (Yellow alert box) Pops up if other user is working on the same survey – All the data is dynamic. (CMS like administration pages. Client can create/edit/delete surveys,etc) – the data is dynamic. (CMS like administration pages. Client can create/edit/delete surveys,etc) – SPA (Single-page-application) experience – Design & UX created from scratch Technologies Advanced JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, Joomla, SPA, Web Design, UX Design, Photoshop.  Data-file downloader Bot Infinata back-end developers requested my help with this project since their previous solution was not really getting the job done. The goal is to download on a daily basis, clinical trials data  records from a third-party company. The request was to come-up with a quick and efficient solution to achieve the goal. The solution, a bot (robot) program to simulate a real web-browser user. This “bot” application is now being run through windows server scheduled tasks. Challenge Find a solution to download heavy xml files on a scheduled basis from third-party service company Technologies and features C# Windows Forms to build a custom web browser, automated actions (macros), architecture the concept and implementation from scratch, Visual Studio.

MARTIN MARQUEZ martin@webect.com • linkedin • 415-730-8155 • Sacramento CA 95835 SENIOR WEB ENGINEER Summary A passionate Web Engineer with more than 15 years of experience working in the Web Development Industry. A solutions builder mind with an entrepreneurial spirit willing to get my hands dirty with code and building rapid prototypes. Excellent problem-solving skills, always find a solution no matter what. Extremely rapid learner in unfamiliar technologies, continuously wowed by the rapid execution and creativity. Strong sense of design due to web design experience. A key engineer that every company must have. #Agile, #Kanban, #Scrumban, #React, #JavaScript, #ES6, #Typescript, #SASS, #CSS3, #HTML5, #C-sharp, #.NET, #MVC, #ASP.NET, #SEO, #MS-SQL, #SDL, #Tridion, #Joomla, #Wordpress, #Drupal, #Custom-made-CMS, #Windows-forms, #VisualBasic, #PSD, #WebDesign, #WireFraming, #Prototyping, #Creativity, #Entrepreneural, #Rollup-sleeves-technologist, #Solutions-builder, #Passionate, #Pioneer-in-tech.  PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  Wells Fargo • San Francisco, CA 94105 • August 2014 – Present Build and maintain sites for Wells Fargo Asset Management. I have created customized web tools and web apps from scratch based on the user needs. Excel in rapid prototyping following the agile methodology.  The sites’ content is managed by a complex CMS named SDL Tridion. I create custom components on this CMS by acquiring user requirements to then build custom components, component templates, page templates, schemas, RAZOR templates, etc., as well as custom CMS’ functionalities (e.g. Custom Resolver). All CMS render and feed data to the front-end side. So, we can say our sites are customized headless (hybrid) Senior Software Engineer  Lead developer  Create rapid web solutions based on the user and team needs  ReactJS and back-end CMS componentizing  Advanced JavaScript (ES5-6) apps to work in harmony with ReactJS  Web design improvements and suggestions  Testing & debugging   Code reviews and approvals // GitHub and SDL Tridion CMS for deployment  Agile – Scrumban and Kanban Recent relevant projects  STICKY-TABS & STICKY-NAV The main challenge was making these apps content-author managed since the CMS dictates areas in the site where a component’s content will be rendered, so a regular tabbed content (where the content of each tab is wrapped in a container that you can easily hide/show) would not work. So, I had to handle the tab panels programmatically by creating -virtual- panels for each tab (Note that we are talking about content that is already wrapped in bootstrap-grid rows and columns) Challenges 
- Content-author manageable without modifying existing functionalities, authors should add these features on any page they wish - Similar approach for the sticky-nav - Do not modify bootstrap grid template nor CMS (SDL Tridion) page template - Converting the tabs and navbar dynamically into dropdown menus for mobile browsers - Need to work in harmony with existing ReactJS components Technologies Advanced JavaScript  ReactJS TypeScript SASS NodeJS and NPM SDL Tridion RAZOR .NET HTML & CSS Bootstrap GitHub VSCode Browser Dev Tools       MANUALLY TRANSPILE LEGACY SERVER-SIDE CODE INTO JAVASCRIPT This was an enormous challenge since the original code was not an official language so there is no documentation at all. Many years passed and no developer or manager wanted to take this project because it was an extreme difficult time consuming and expensive effort. It was until recently (late 2020) that we had no option we had to address this technical debt or we would be in big trouble, so I started working on it on my end (outside of work hours, and many weekends) and I made a huge progress so I told the team that it was in fact do-able without hiring SDL Experts (which would take them at least a year). No one believed me at first until they say the huge progress that I had done. So at the end, I re-built this important section (Fund Profiles), and finally got rid of all the dependencies on the terrible custom tag-language made by a third-party company. This was a big win for the team and the company. I got big recognition for my ‘stubbornness’ to fix the ‘impossible’. Technologies Advanced JavaScript  SDL Tridion TypeScript HTML & CSS Bootstrap RSTL (custom tag-language) GitHub VSCode NodeJS and NPM   SDL TRIDION CUSTOM RESOLVER This was another big challenge since the current custom resolver was causing publishing issues, which is critical for the business. The company hired an expensive SDL expert who ended not being able to fix the issue. So, here is where I volunteered again regardless the skepticism of the team.  In a few weeks I was able to write a new Custom Resolver that was simpler and faster, saving the company which made me gain another recognition.
